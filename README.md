# Pinball-simulation

Welcome to the Pinball Simulator project! This simulator provides an immersive experience, simulating the physics and dynamics of a classic pinball game. It is designed to offer users an interactive journey through the fundamental principles of physics and motion in a pinball environment.

## Overview

The Pinball Simulator features a dynamic pinball board filled with obstacles, targets, and intricate trajectories. Users can propel the ball into play using the launch mechanism in the bottom right corner. The flippers, strategically placed at the bottom, can be controlled with arrow keys or mouse clicks. The User Interface (UI) enhances the user experience with interactive elements and informative displays, incorporating CSS animations for a visually engaging environment.

## Classroom Integration

This project integrates concepts learned in the Graphics Computing course:

- **Canvas and API:** The Canvas element serves as the core for rendering the simulation environment, harnessing the powerful 2D graphics capabilities and extensive API.

- **Trajectories:** Utilizing BÃ©zier curves, Quadratics, or direct movements in the Canvas coordinate system to create captivating ball paths.

- **Animation Cycle:** Smooth and continuous animations are achieved through the animation cycle, utilizing `window.requestAnimationFrame` for a lifelike pinball experience.

- **Objects, Interactivity, and Physics:** The simulation incorporates precise physics for realistic interactions, from the propulsion mechanism to the ball's behavior.

## Technical Details

The project is under continuous refinement, with considerations including:

- **Graphical Environment:** Evaluation of methods for creating the graphical environment and user interface, choosing between direct Canvas implementation or external resources for optimal performance and realism.

- **Graphical Representation:** The project predominantly follows a vectorial approach for graphical representation.
